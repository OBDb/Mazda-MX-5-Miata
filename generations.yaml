generations:
  - name: "First Generation (NA)"
    start_year: 1989
    end_year: 1997
    description: "The original Mazda MX-5 Miata revolutionized the affordable sports car market, reviving the classic British roadster formula with Japanese reliability. Following the principle of 'Jinba Ittai' (horse and rider as one), it featured a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, double-wishbone suspension at all four corners, and a perfect 50:50 weight distribution. The compact, lightweight design (weighing just 2,150 pounds) featured pop-up headlights, a simple manual soft top, and minimalist styling. Initially powered by a 1.6L four-cylinder engine producing 116 horsepower, paired with a precise five-speed manual transmission, it prioritized handling and driving enjoyment over straight-line speed. For 1994, the engine was upgraded to a 1.8L producing 128 horsepower (later 133 hp). The simple interior focused entirely on driving, with well-placed controls, supportive seats, and an analog gauge cluster. Special editions included the limited-production BRG (British Racing Green) with tan interior, various 'M Edition' models with unique colors and equipment, and the track-focused R Package with stiffer suspension and minimal luxury features. The first-generation Miata won numerous awards including Car and Driver's '10Best' list for seven consecutive years and established the model as an iconic affordable sports car. Its simple, reliable, and endlessly enjoyable character has made it a favorite among driving enthusiasts and the most popular roadster in history with over 400,000 first-generation units sold."

  - name: "Second Generation (NB)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The second-generation Miata evolved the winning formula with more modern styling, replacing the pop-up headlights with fixed units while maintaining compact dimensions and light weight. The updated design featured more pronounced fenders, a more aggressive front fascia, and improved aerodynamics. Structurally, it was significantly more rigid than its predecessor, improving both handling precision and safety. Powered by a revised 1.8L engine producing 140 horsepower (142 hp from 2001), paired with an improved five-speed manual, a new six-speed manual (in higher trims), or an optional four-speed automatic transmission. The interior saw refinements including better ergonomics, more supportive seats, and additional passenger space despite similar exterior dimensions. Significant variants included the 10th Anniversary Edition featuring a six-speed transmission, Bilstein suspension, and unique blue color scheme; the high-performance Mazdaspeed Miata (2004-2005) with a factory turbocharger boosting output to 178 horsepower alongside suspension and braking upgrades; and various special editions with unique colors and equipment. The second generation successfully updated the Miata concept with enhanced performance, safety, and refinement while maintaining the original's focus on pure driving enjoyment, further cementing its position as the benchmark affordable sports car."

  - name: "Third Generation (NC)"
    start_year: 2006
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The third-generation Miata (officially marketed as the MX-5 Miata in North America) represented the most substantial redesign in the model's history, growing slightly in size and adding more modern features while remaining true to its lightweight sports car roots. The exterior design became more sculptural with flared fenders, a wider stance, and more contemporary styling. Built on an all-new platform with 47% greater torsional rigidity than its predecessor, it featured sophisticated double-wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension for improved handling and ride quality. Powered by a new 2.0L MZR engine producing 170 horsepower (later reduced to 167 hp due to emissions changes), paired with improved five-speed and six-speed manual transmissions or an optional six-speed automatic with paddle shifters. For the first time, a power retractable hardtop model (PRHT) was offered alongside the soft top, providing coupe-like refinement with open-air versatility. The interior quality improved significantly with better materials, more modern amenities, and improved noise isolation. Special editions included the track-oriented Club Sport package, luxury-focused Special Edition models, and the 25th Anniversary Edition featuring unique design elements and premium equipment. Throughout its production, the NC received several updates including revised front styling in 2009 and numerous special editions. Despite growing in size and sophistication, the third-generation maintained the Miata's engaging driving character while offering more power and refinement than previous models."

    end_year: null
    description: "The current MX-5 Miata returned to its roots with a focus on lightweight design and compact dimensions, shedding nearly 220 pounds from its predecessor while incorporating modern technology and safety features. The exterior features sharp, contemporary styling with a lower hood line, aggressive LED headlights, and more sculpted body lines creating the most visually distinctive Miata to date. Initially powered by a 2.0L SkyActiv-G engine producing 155 horsepower with a focus on responsive low-end torque, it received a significant update for 2019 with power increased to 181 horsepower and a higher 7,500 rpm redline. All models feature either a precise six-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed automatic with paddle shifters. The ND introduced the RF (Retractable Fastback) variant featuring a power-folding hardtop that maintains a coupe-like silhouette even when open. The driver-focused interior combines traditional sports car elements with modern technology, including available Mazda Connect infotainment with a 7-inch touchscreen, Bose audio system, and heated leather seats. For the first time, driver assistance features became available including blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and rear cross-traffic alert. Special editions include the 30th Anniversary model with exclusive Racing Orange paint and unique RAYS ZE40 forged wheels, and the Miata RF Club with available Brembo/BBS package featuring performance brakes, forged wheels, and Recaro seats. The fourth-generation successfully modernizes the Miata while maintaining its pure sports car character, once again earning critical acclaim for its exceptional handling, engaging driving experience, and accessible performance."
